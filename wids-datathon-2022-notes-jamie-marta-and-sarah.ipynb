Addressing climate change involves mitigation (i.e. mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (i.e. preparing for unavoidable consequences). Mitigation of GHG emissions requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the lifecycle of buildings from construction to demolition were responsible for 37% of global energy-related and process-related CO2 emissions in 2020. Yet it is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies. For example, retrofitted buildings can reduce heating and cooling energy requirements by 50-90 percent. Many of these energy efficiency measures also result in overall cost savings and yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nfrom datetime import date","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-15T18:06:47.318193Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-15T18:06:47.318637Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-15T18:06:48.412844Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-15T18:06:47.318544Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-15T18:06:48.411915Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 1: let's take a look at the data\nThe dataset consists of:\n- building characteristics (e.g. floor area, facility type etc), \n- weather data for the location of the building (e.g. annual average temperature, annual total precipitation etc)\n- the energy usage for the building and the given year, measured as Site Energy Usage Intensity (Site EUI). \n\nEach row in the data corresponds to the a single building observed in a given year.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#read in data\nbuildings = pd.read_csv(r'../input/widsdatathon2022/train.csv')\nprint(buildings.shape)\nbuildings.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-15T18:36:58.468577Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-15T18:36:58.468876Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-15T18:36:58.98217Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-15T18:36:58.468846Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-15T18:36:58.98131Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preparing the data\n\nBefore we can feed the data into our model we need to clean the data to make sure everything is in the format we would like it.
